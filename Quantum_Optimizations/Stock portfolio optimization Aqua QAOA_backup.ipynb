Particularly, it is shown how to setup the MinimumEigenOptimizer using QAOA accordingly. For a given set of shots with corresponding objective values of the considered optimization problem, the CVaR with confidence level α∈[0,1] is defined as the average of the α best shots. Thus, α=1 corresponds to the standard expected value, while α=0 corresponds to the minimum of the given shots, and α∈(0,1) is a tradeoff between focusing on better shots, but still applying some
